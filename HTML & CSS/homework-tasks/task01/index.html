		<p>
			In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging
			code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic
			Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and
			debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the
			duck.Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different
			(usually) inanimate objects, or pets such as a dog or a cat.
